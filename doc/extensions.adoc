=== Supported extensions

MoonVulkan supports the core Vulkan API, plus most of the Khronos (KHR) and
multivendor (EXT) extensions. 

It also supports any extension that does not require API calls other than that for enabling it.

It does not support Khronos experimental extensions (KHX) and single vendor extensions (AMD, GOOGLE, NV, ...).
